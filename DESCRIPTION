Description: Tools to analyzed the distributions of genomic annotations in relations to domain (i.e TADs or compartments). 
  This package allow to plot coverage or distributions of any annotations (genes, DNA binding motifs like CTCF...) within or around domains.
  Plot functions to visualized domains with other tracks (covegare, annotation and bedgraph datas). 
  Plot functions allow to visualyzed domains in a genomic regions with datas generally associated with domain analysis. Those plot functions uses the Gviz package in order to facilitate the visualiizzation of this type of datas.
